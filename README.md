# Building and Running

Start by cloning the repository and setting up a virtual environment:

```sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Then, install the required packages:

```sh
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can run the bot using the following command:

```sh
python main.py --help
```

Tests can be run with:

```sh
python -m unittest discover
```

You can install the bot via

```sh
uv pip install .
```

and once installed run it via

```sh
hops --help
```

### Running hops

Hops expects to have access via the serial interface or via TCP. It does **not** run via BLE.

To run via the serial interface,

```sh
hops --serial
```

and via TCP,

```sh
hops --tcp <ip_address>
```

By default hops will create a sqlite database `db.sqlite` in the current directory. Alternatively you can specify a different database file with the `--db` option:

```sh
hops --serial --db /path/to/db.sqlite
```
